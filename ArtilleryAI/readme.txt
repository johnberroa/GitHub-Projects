ArtilleryAI Readme
------------------
This program is intended to be an environment to test various learning algorithms, as well as their generality.  It simulates artillery shooting a shell at a target.  A GUI is planned for the future in order to visualize what the network is doing better than just a number printout.

Learning Algorithms:
Artificial Neural Network
Reinforcement Learning (which type yet I have not yet decided, but should be able to do multiple)

Generality Test:
Will be able to switch which variable the algorithm controls.  In this way, a trained network on one variable can be tested to see if it genearlizes/learns faster for a new variable. (e.g. angle then to projectile mass).
