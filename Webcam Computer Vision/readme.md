# Webcam Fun

## What it does

This script turns on the webcam and allows the user to apply different filters inspired by computer vision.  Screenshots can also be taken with ``s``.  The types of filters available are:
- Grayscale with ``g``
- Color with ``c``
- Difference image with ``d``
- Erosion (called "Blocky") with ``b``
- Dilation (called "Alien") with ``a``
- Difference image without thresholding (called "Phantom") with ``p``
