# The Gambler's Fallacy

This is a coin tossing test of the gambler's fallacy.  More info in the notebook.  To put it simply, it tosses tons of coins and tries to predict the next coin toss based on these strategies:
- Random: Always chooses a random guess, regardless of previous occurences
- Heads Only: Always chooses heads
- Equal Probability: Will mostly choose the least frequent side
- Recent Probability: Will mostly choose the least frequent side over some past number of trials
